They can see the connections between biographies and history, personal problems and historical currents, pierce the seamless fabric of common sense that envelopes the everyday life of societies, draw connections between seemingly independent social factors, processes and institutions using observation and analysis. \nBeing trained in a highly context‐sensitive discipline, a sociology graduate is alert to social, cultural and historical context of all issues. In the Indian context, it implies an ingrained post‐colonial sensibility that critically engages constitutions of self and engagement with the other. Sociology is a deeply self‐reflexive discipline with an inter‐disciplinary orientation. A sociology graduate is exposed to a significant quantum of concepts, conceptual writing, theories and theoretical reasoning throughout the three years across all the courses. Hence students have an ability to grasp and generate a conceptual conversation in general and within the discipline of sociology in particular. \nThey are also familiar with well‐defined, critical and evolving multiplicity of theoretical perspectives. A sociology graduate would be well versed with the basic tenets of these perspectives and capable of generating versions of social world from these perspectives. Endowed with this awareness of multiple perspectives on any significant issue a sociology graduate is able to reason it out and weigh the various operational options in any given context. \n### Program Specific Outcomes\nThe Department of Sociology, Bharati College has provided theoretical training to students through analytical assignments, seminars, discussions, film screenings and various other activities. The department regularly organises special lectures by experts from outside and other disciplinary theme based activities. The students have produced short films, ethnographic films, undertaken research projects that involved field work. Some of the students have interned with government and worked on their social welfare projects and with prominent civil society organisations.\nA sociology graduate is ideal for employment needs where a graduate from liberal arts would fit in for this rare blend. They are a perfect fit for the following areas (but not limited to them alone) such as law, development studies, development practice, social work, bureaucracy and public institutions, women’s studies, gender studies, area studies, international relations, policy studies, policy implementation, advocacy, management, marketing, social psychology, industrial organization, election studies, data sciences, journalism, criminology, and careers in fine and performing arts.\n### Course Outcomes\nThrough the course, the students: \n  * Possess specialized knowledge of a range of social institutions and processes. Through courses on Indian society, political, economic, religion, kinship and family, gender and social stratification they have a fine grasp of social structures, processes, institutions, cultural diversities and dynamics of social change along with attendant conceptual tool kit of the discipline. \n  * Become instinctually comparative across and within the cultures. They are trained to spot social patterns and trends and seek causation at the level of social and cultural collectives to explain the observed social regularities. They are averse to attaching undue causal weight to individual subjective understandings and are resistant to unfounded ethnocentric assumptions. \n  * Have a specialized understanding of sociological conversation around Sociology of Gender; Social Stratification; Urban Sociology; Agrarian Sociology; Environmental Sociology; Sociology of Work and Industry; Health and Medicine; Visual Cultures; Indian Sociological Traditions and Reading Ethnographic Monographs. Sociology is both precise and evocative in the representation of the results of its scholarly labours. It is also keenly aware of its role in educating the public and dispelling common misconceptions and prejudices. Hence good communications skills are imperative for a sociology graduate. Sociological communication takes three principle forms: oral, written and visual. \n  * Become well equipped to mobilize their sociological knowledge and generic skills for a variety of purposes apart from academic pursuit of the discipline. Sociology graduates are equipped to grasp vast quantities of diversely textured complex material and synthesise it into coherent and cogent arguments backed by evidence. \n  * Inculcate an ability to engage in collaborative work and constructive, purposive and democratic conversations. They are well trained for critical thinking that matches their research skills which enables them to evaluate strengths and weaknesses of arguments in a scientific fashion. \n[Additional Link](http://du.ac.in/du/uploads/Syllabus_2015/B.A.%20Hons.%20Sociology.pdf)\n##  __Department of Journalism\n### Program Outcomes\nThe Department of Journalism, Bharati College offers a B.A. Hons course to undergraduate students and is committed to providing undergraduate students with quality education in the communication and journalism disciplines that is contemporary, relevant and practical.

The medium of instruction is primarily through well- prepared printed course material which is distributed by mail to all the enrolled students. This is supplemented through Personal Contact Program (PCP) conducted for the benefit of students at various study centers run by the SOL.\nThe PCP center at Bharati College started in 2014, and its commencement coincided with the launch of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan of Delhi University and the Honorable Prime Minister of India. The entire staff and students of the center took the pledge for “Swachh Bharat” while inaugurating the center on 12th October 2014.\nWe are one of the best PCP centers of SOL in terms of infrastructure and administration. The center offers quality education and all facilities which are available for regular students like fully furnished class rooms, well-equipped Computer Lab, lawns and neat wash-rooms. The center has an infrastructure capacity to serve around 500 students. The center engages 30 to 40 teachers per semester every year. We have a bunch of highly capable and committed teachers who, apart from giving classroom lectures, help in preparing a question bank for the study material of SOL students. The SOL-PCP Bharati College office functions from Room No.12 of the College Building. The Students may contact the staff for seeking information about SOL-PCP on Sundays during working hours.\nThe Bharati College PCP runs for the girl students of B.Com 1st, 2nd and 3rd year of SOL. We conduct a small orientation for faculty and students to explain the Time-Table and other aspects of functioning of the center. The supporting staff guides the students in finding their classrooms, meeting the teachers concerned and any other facilitation that they may require. MTS staff is deputed on every floor to guide the students. We follow a strict attendance mechanism at the point of entry and through mobile app in order to maintain discipline in the center.\nThe College organizes co-curricular and extra-curricular activities for the all-round development of the students. Cash prizes are also distributed to give encouragement. The center also organizes Placement Drive for SOL-PCP students from time to time. The SOL-PCP has also implemented CBCS from the academic session 2019-2020.\n[SOL Timetable for Month of Sept to Nov 2024](https://www.bharaticollege.du.ac.in/uploads/academics/special-study-programs/sol)\n### CONTACT\nEmail ID: [sol@bharati.du.ac.in](mailto:sol@bharati.du.ac.in)\nPhone: [ 011-43273050](tel:011-43273050)\n[×](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n[__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bharaticollegeDU/) [__Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bharati_college/) [__ Twitter](https://twitter.com/bharati_college) [__Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@SocialMedia-bt8vr/featured) [__Media Coverage](https://www.bharaticollege.du.ac.in/media-coverage) [__Search](javascript:void\\(0\\);)",

The building of the Hostel was inaugurated on 16 February 2017. The hostel facility of the college is a great attraction for outstation and foreign students and a landmark among the colleges of Delhi University in West Delhi. \nThis can be termed as the ‘home away from home’ exclusively for outstation students. Apart from various facilities, the hostel provides a comfortable and safe stay for them. \nThe Hostel is the epicentre of initiative and energy and the denizens of the Hostel work hard to provide the much needed support for scripts, rangoli, music and performances. There is always continuous negotiation about the ground rules of living together. \nFrom providing a safe space for women who wished to acquire a Bachelors degree, it is helping the residents to step into the space of responsible citizenship. The balance between rights and duties is carefully calibrated. It is also about being a caring community that celebrates diversity across regional, linguistic, class, religious and ideological differences and embraces an identity of womanhood that is confident, poised and ready to grapple with the challenges and opportunities that await them Post College. Residents participate actively in the maintenance of the hostel and use environment-friendly measures to make the hostel a better place to live. \nMerit is one of the main criteria that are considered before offering the hostel facilities to the students. \nHostel affairs are coordinated under the guidance and supervision of the resident warden. The hostel committee under the chairmanship of the Principal frames the rules and regulations. \n### Hostel Committee\n  * Prof. Saloni Gupta (Principal)\n  * Prof. Rajni (Hostel Warden Ex Officio)\n  * Dr. Vandana Bansal (Convener)\n  * Ms. Sunita Srivastava (Hostel Manager)\n  * Dr. Deepti Singh (Sanskrit)\n  * Dr. Nishtha Bhushan\n  * Dr. Bindiya Trivedi\n  * Ms. Seema Kwatra\n  * Dr. Anuranjita Wadhwa\n  * Mr. I.

The College was founded in 1971 with its premises at Karol Bagh. It shifted to its present location at Janak Puri in July 1998. Enriched by a faculty of over 130 qualified and dedicated teachers, the college caters to around 3500 students. Our alumni have excelled as academicians, lawyers, chartered accountants, politicians, administrators, sports persons, artists and as corporate leaders. Bharati College proudly counts renowned singer **Maithili Thakur** —recognized by the Prime Minister as a cultural ambassador—among its alumni, reflecting its commitment to nurturing talent and excellence. We are confident that all those who join Bharati will reach great heights. \nThis legacy of excellence is deeply woven into our heritage and is inextricably linked with some of India's most eminent public figures- including a former deputy Prime Minister and two former Chief ministers of Delhi. The first Governing Body of the College was chaired by **Bharat Ratna Shri L.K. Advani** , former Deputy Prime Minister of India, with Shri Madan Lal Khurana, (former Chief Minister of Delhi and, later, Governor of Rajasthan), serving as Treasurer. Recognising the importance of a good library for any academic institution, **Dr. Sahib Singh Verma** , former Chief Minister of Delhi, laid the foundation for an impressive library system that continues to benefit students to this day. \nThe current campus at Janak Puri was inaugurated by **Padma Vibhushan** **Smt. Sushma Swaraj** , then Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting, who later served with distinction as the External Affairs Minister of India. \nThe college is situated in an area of about 8.6 acres of land which has a newly inaugurated state-of-the-art auditorium, a women’s hostel, a new academic block, 4 computer labs with over 150 computers with broadband connectivity, a seminar room, a conference room, a theatre room and a large, well-equipped library. The library provides access to e-journals, books and other information that can be freely used by students and faculty. \nAlong with the degree courses, the college also offers a multitude of add-on, short-term courses at very affordable fees for all interested students from within and outside of the College. These include courses in many foreign languages such as German, French, Russian, Chinese; IT courses at 'O' and 'A' levels and three more Computer Courses (Certified Web Developer, Certified Data Entry and Office Assistant and Computer Concepts) in collaboration with NIELIT and two additional courses in various professional fields such as Tax and Accounting as well as Digital Marketing. \nThe students are required to participate in co-curricular activities (NSS, NCC and Sports). The College has a very active cell of the National Service Scheme as well as a very capable and enthusiastic wing of the National Cadet Corps. The NSS works with physically and visually challenged students, inmates of the Tihar Jail, as support staff for the nearby Deen Dayal Hospital and with many other agencies. The NCC parade takes place on Thursdays and Saturdays. Many of our NCC cadets go qualify for the ‘C’ and ‘B’ Certificates, making them eligible for employment in the army and other wings of the government. \nIn sports, the College has extensive fields with a volleyball court, kho-kho and throw ball fields and a fully developed cricket ground. Any student interested in sports is welcome to join the various teams, even if she has not been admitted on the sports quota. \nThe various departments, through their Departmental Societies, aim at guiding and training students beyond the University curriculum by organizing lectures, seminars, workshops, cultural programmes, excursions, etc. It is mandatory for students to participate in annual functions such as Annual Day, Sports Day, NCC Day and NSS Day. Over and above these, for their holistic growth and development, students are expected to participate in at least five other functions organized in the College. \nBharati College is also proud of **Nishi Bhardwaj, who was crowned Miss Earth in 2018** , reflecting the opportunities for growth we strive to provide to our students. The College offers many extra-curricular options. It has many vibrant societies, such as, a dramatics society _Chilman_ , _Advaita_ , a society for contemporary dance; _Elantre_ , where students try their hands in the world of fashion; _Chintan_ , a debating society, _Mridang_ for classical music and dance; _Manthan_ , the Nukkad Natak society; _Jagriti_ , the women’s development cell, _Kavya_ : _abhivyakti ka sajha manch_ , for the ones who have a passion for poetry writing. _Artsvilla_ provides a platform to unleash their talents and explore their creativity, _Palaash_ , an Eco-club that keeps the College green and _Upkram_ , the E-cell, enables its students to get first-hand experience in entrepreneurship and promote innovation. For details you may refer to the section on societies in the upcoming pages. \nNational Assessment and Accreditation Council (An Autonomous Institution of University Grant Commission) on recommendation of a duly appointed Peer Team declared Bharati College as Accredited with CGPA of 2.98 at B  ++  on a four-point scale. \nFor those seeking a transformative educational experience that transcends beyond boundaries and unlocks limitless potential, Bharati College is the destination. The college invites aspiring scholars to embark on a journey of discovery, growth and empowerment. Welcome to Bharati College, where minds are empowered, lives are enriched and futures are shaped. \n[×](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n[__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bharaticollegeDU/) [__Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bharati_college/) [__ Twitter](https://twitter.com/bharati_college) [__Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@SocialMedia-bt8vr/featured) [__Media Coverage](https://www.bharaticollege.du.ac.in/media-coverage) [__Search](javascript:void\\(0\\);)",

Established in 1971 under the Memorandum of Association and Rules of the **Bharati Mahila College Society** , JhandeWalan, New Delhi, the college began its journey amidst several infrastructural challenges, notably the absence of a proper campus and the need to share space with Government Boys Higher Secondary School, Karol Bagh. \nTo lay the foundation of this new institution, Mrs. Kailash Kudesia, Deputy Director of Education (Science), was entrusted with the responsibility as Officer on Special Duty (OSD). In September 1971, the college appointed its first team of 12 teaching faculty members, and the appointment of the first Principal, Dr. (Mrs.) Lalita Panigrahi, followed in October 1971. The first administrative team included: Shri C.K. Jain – Superintendent (Accounts), Ms. Usha Gulati – Professional Assistant, Mr. M.K. Mehta – Upper Division Clerk, Mr. S.C. Gupta – Cashier, Ms. Madhu Wadhwa – Library Clerk, Shri D.P. Pandey- Assistant (LDC) and Mr. Garibha Ram – Library Attendants. Class IV employees who played a key role in college operations included: Shri Kamlesh, Shri Amar Singh, Shri Tara Chand, Shri Vishal Mani. \nTogether with the founding teaching faculty, the newly recruited non-teaching staff laid the foundation of Bharati College brick by brick with dedication and teamwork. This spirit of collaboration continued over the years, with faculty and non-teaching staff appointed after the founding members making significant contributions to the college's growth and development. \nThe college opened its doors with an initial intake of 295 students for the B.A. programme, and 50 admissions were transferred by the University of Delhi from a college at Timarpur. Of the 337 students who appeared in the first examination, an impressive 331 were promoted— establishing a strong academic foundation from the outset. \nA significant milestone in the college’s formation was the first meeting of the Governing Body held on **18th January 1972** , chaired by Shri V.N. Wanchoo, Additional Director of Education, Delhi Administration. In this meeting, **Shri Lal Krishan Advani (Former Deputy Prime Minister of India) was unanimously elected as the founder Chairman, and Shri Madan Lal Khurana (Former Chief Minister of Delhi & Former Governor of Rajasthan) as the first Treasurer of the Governing Body**.\nShri Lal Krishan Advani ji played a pivotal role in the formative years of the college. Being visionary leader, he actively participated in all Governing Body meetings, providing valuable guidance. It was on his suggestion that the spelling of “Bharti” was officially changed to “Bharati” to reflect a deeper cultural and linguistic authenticity.\nThe college crest, a symbol of its identity and aspirations, was designed by Ms. Raj Kale, a Governing Body member. It bears the Sanskrit motto:\n\"न ही ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते\"   \n(There is nothing in this world more sacred than learning)\nThe library is a vital component of any institution of higher education, and **Dr. Sahib Singh Verma, former Chief Minister of Delhi,** played a foundational role in establishing a strong library infrastructure as the college’s first librarian. \nAmong the pioneering faculty members, Mrs. Veena Dutta served as the college’s first Bursar. Ms. Pramodini Varma (formerly Pramodini Dube) and Ms. Veena Puri (formerly Veena Duggal) represented the faculty in the Governing Body. The first Staff Council was constituted on 17th July 1972, with Ms. Usha Rani elected as its first Secretary and Ms. Urmil Bhatia as its first Treasurer. Among the first faculty appointees, Ms. Uma Anand was regarded as one of the most trusted and dependable members of the college. She was entrusted with the important responsibility of conducting examinations and was appointed as the Deputy Superintendent of Examinations. \nThis spirit of trust and togetherness reflected the familial bond shared by the early members of Bharati College. A human touch and strong bond were not only shared among the teaching & non- teaching staff but also extended to the students, forming a core part of the college's ethos. One of the most cherished traditions was the farewell party for students, where all cultural performances were presented by the teachers themselves, creating unforgettable memories. A signature element of the event was the qawwali performance—one group representing the emotions of the students and the other, the heartfelt sentiments of the teachers. \nThe college has always been deeply committed to community outreach through its NSS (National Service Scheme) programmes. Ms. Mohini Chugh, the first NSS Officer, organized the college’s inaugural NSS camp outside the campus, setting the tone for future engagement with the community. \nThe **NCC** unit of the college has been active and commendable since its inception, under the dedicated leadership of a full-fledged NCC officer, Ms. Vijay Bhalla. Notably, on 21st March 1978, Shri L.K. Advani attended the Annual NCC Day and appreciated the outstanding work of the NCC unit. **Sports** has been another strong pillar of the college since its inception, nurtured and strengthened under the able leadership of Ms. Amarjeet Sandhu. \n**The founding principal, Mrs. Lalita Panigrahi** , a distinguished History faculty member from Lady Shri Ram College, laid a strong academic foundation by appointing highly qualified and meritorious teachers. She emphasized recruiting faculty with outstanding academic credentials, setting a benchmark of excellence that continues to define Bharati College. In 1973, the B.Com. (Pass) course was introduced, followed by the college’s first Honours programme—B.A. (Hons.) Political Science—in 1976. The academic offerings steadily expanded over the years: Hindi Honours in 1977, Sanskrit Honours in 1987, B.Com. (Hons.) in 1989, English Honours in 1990, and History Honours in the same year under her able leadership. \nIn its meeting held on 29th May 1998, the Governing Body resolved that **Bharati Mahila College would henceforth be known as** **Bharati College**. This change was subsequently approved by the Executive Council in its meeting held on 13th November 1998 \nA turning point in the college’s history came with the **allotment of land in Janakpuri** for a permanent campus. The project, initially stalled, was revived and brought to life by **Mrs. Mohini Chugh** , the then officiating principal. She undertook the daunting task of navigating the complex paperwork, securing approvals from various civic agencies—Municipal Corporation, Jal Board, Electricity Department—and overseeing the construction of the new campus. Thanks to her **relentless dedication and leadership** , the current campus was completed and became functional within just three years (1995–1998), and the college shifted to its **present premises at C-4, Janakpuri, on 20th September 1998** .****The campus was inaugurated by**Smt. Sushma Swaraj, the then Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting** , in the esteemed presence of Dr. Jagdish Mukhi, the then Finance Minister of Delhi. Dr. Mukhi, as the MLA of the Janakpuri constituency, played a pivotal role in facilitating the relocation to the new premises. \n**Dr. Asha Gupta** , a renowned academician, led the college from **2000 to 2003** , further strengthening the institution's academic environment before taking on the role of Director, Hindi Division, University of Delhi. \nHer successor, **Dr. Pramodini Varma** , brought a visionary zeal that transformed the college into a hub of cultural and intellectual vibrancy. Her tenure focused on promoting **co-curricular and extra-curricular activities** , fostering all-round development. Under her stewardship, several infrastructural developments took place, including the creation of a **Theatre Room, Committee Room, and Seminar Room** , and the **laying of the foundation stones of the Girls’ Hostel, the Auditorium, and the new academic block** . The college further enhanced its academic profile with the introduction of M.A. Hindi in 2002 in her tenure. \nA brief but warm leadership was provided by **Dr. Kanta Rani Bhatia** , who served as Officiating Principal for a year. During a period of administrative turmoil and challenging circumstances, **Dr. Sandhya Jain** took charge as Acting Principal of the college and efficiently managed its affairs during a brief tenure of **four months, from July 2016 to November 2016** .The next chapter was shaped by **Dr. Mukti Sanyal** , who served as the officiating principal and was admired for her **empathetic leadership** . She provided a sense of **ease, accessibility, and support** , always ready to listen to and address the concerns of students, parents, and staff. Her approach created a compassionate environment and a culture of mutual respect and growth. She played a pivotal role in the introduction of four prestigious Honours programmes—Sociology, Psychology, Journalism, and Mathematics—in 2017, marking a significant milestone in the institution’s continued growth and commitment to academic excellence. During the challenging COVID-19 period (2020–2022), Dr. Rekha Sapra served as the officiating principal. \nEach of these leaders, along with the **dedicated faculty and staff—past and present—have contributed immensely to the growth and reputation of Bharati College** . Today, the college stands tall with a **sprawling campus, lush gardens, a modern auditorium, a Girls’ Hostel** , and state-of-the-art facilities, befitting a leading modern institution of higher education. \nFrom its humble beginnings to its current stature, **Bharati College’s journey is a testament to resilience, visionary leadership, and unwavering commitment to excellence in women’s education.**\n[×](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n[__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bharaticollegeDU/) [__Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bharati_college/) [__ Twitter](https://twitter.com/bharati_college) [__Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@SocialMedia-bt8vr/featured) [__Media Coverage](https://www.bharaticollege.du.ac.in/media-coverage) [__Search](javascript:void\\(0\\);)",

At times they may feel stressed and interfering in their pursuits. There is cross cultural, neo-ethnic convergence, increasing academic competition, Peer pressure, unique adolescent problems, mounting career demand, etc. among the student community. To prevent student going through these stress factors and to help them overcome the above mentioned problems, the Faculty Mentor and counsellor system are implemented in the College where in a teacher acts as Faculty Mentor and counsellor to a group of students. \nEach teacher helps the students to cope up academically, give personal Counselling, extend career guidance, support co-curricular activities, co-ordinate welfare activities, interact with their parents, seek student’s involvement in pursuit of college vision and objectives and establish healthy, co-operative and academic ambience in the College. \nThe mentoring programme at Bharati College, a constituent all girls college of University of Delhi is perhaps the only programme of its kind in the entire University where the students choose their faculty mentor. \n###  AIM \nIt aims to provide students an opportunity to gain exposure and benefit from the association with a faculty with experience, expertise and wisdom. It helps to anchor them in an alien atmosphere, devoid of a familiar familial system. \n###  VISION \nThe mentorship programme should aim to create and nurture a supportive environment for the incumbents, give them proper and correct guidance, direction and equip them with much needed career skills. \n###  OBJECTIVES \nIt fulfils a very important gap right from the First semester as the college caters to girl students converging as admission seekers in various courses, offered by the college from across the country and in some cases- beyond. These students have to be hand held to indoctrinate them into the University and Institutional system and being fresh from school, they have to quickly adjust to achieve the right balance by taking the much needed quantum jump from a regimented school system to a more open college system. \nA number of students esp. outstation students need to be guided regarding rules and regulations, dos and don’ts related to administration & academic queries and issues as also typical problems they face that they may not be comfortable sharing in their families/parents. The faculty chosen by the students to be their mentors play a big role in helping them through the myriad issues and queries they raise during the mentorship meeting and even later \n###  PRACTICE \nOnce the first semester students choose their respective faculty mentors, they decide on specific days in a week on a mutually agreed basis to meet face to face to raise concerns they may be facing- of any kind, individually or in group – ranging from mental, psychological, social, career related or even financial. \nThe students living alone or even in hostel are the most susceptible as they have to handle everything right from doing their daily chores to managing the totally different academic and sometimes administrative expectations. The mentorship program helps to settle their nerves and is like a support mechanism they can bank upon. The students appreciate the help extended by the mentors who often go the extra mile whenever approached. The endeavour of the faculty mentors has always been to help students gain the much needed confidence in their formative years. It is a time intensive activity and requires mentees to open up which in certain cases may take time especially with introverts. A continuous feedback system is maintained as also mentee record. \n###  OUTCOME \nThe program since its inception has helped numerous students to quickly settle down in a totally different environment as well as improving their ability to handle the changing expectation by the stakeholders. \n###  EXPECTATION FROM FACULTY MENTORS \n  * Create a trust-based relation while maintain due distance with the mentees \n  * Explain the mentorship programme by creating shared understanding \n  * Guide the students to overcome any problems or issues faced, to scale them up to the requisite authorised person/body for quick and smooth resolution \n  * Assist the mentees to do a SWOC (Strength – Weakness – Opportunity – Challenges analysis and provide constructive feedback \n  * Maintain regular contact with the mentees \n  * Foster career skills relevant for the mentees \n  * Identify students with below far performance and identity the reasons so that the problem areas can be identified and weeded out. \n  * Closely work with mentees facing behaviour issues and scale it to the counselling centre. \n###  MENTESS ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES \n  * Responsibility to establish contact for meeting as they have chosen their faculty mentors. \n  * Use technology to air grievance or inform about any problem/issues if face to face interaction is not possible. \n  * The mentee should spare enough time to gain and get maximum output from the mentorship programme. \nMentees should not hesitate indirectly confronting the problem and bringing it to the attention of the mentors. \n###  DO’S FOR MENTORS \n  1. Fix time of meeting and meet periodically. \n  2. Know Academic requirements – Help them. \n  3. Know personal requirements – Counsel them. \n  4. Know Career & Higher Education requirements – Guide them. \n  5. Know financial / welfare requirements – Co-ordinate & Direct them. \n  6. Know their Parents / Guardians – Interact with them. \n  7. Know College Objective & Goals – convey to Students & Seek their role. \n  8. Know College activities – seek their Involvement. \n  9. For a change – Organize Excursion. \n  10. With Student(s), help establish Healthy, Co-operative, Academic ambience in the College. \n###  DON’TS FOR MENTORS \n  1. Not to call Students to your Home. Meetings to be held only in College Premises \n  2. Not to dictate – rather facilitate. \n  3. Not to use them for Personal Work. \n  4. Avoid imposing anything on students. Provide only what they desire, if feasible. \n[×](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n[__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bharaticollegeDU/) [__Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bharati_college/) [__ Twitter](https://twitter.com/bharati_college) [__Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@SocialMedia-bt8vr/featured) [__Media Coverage](https://www.bharaticollege.du.ac.in/media-coverage) [__Search](javascript:void\\(0\\);)",

Addressing these issues requires the fostering of rural development in harmony with Gandhi's vision of self-sufficient 'village republics,' utilizing local resources and deploying decentralized, eco-friendly technologies. This approach aims to locally meet essential needs like food, clothing, shelter, sanitation, healthcare, energy, livelihood , transportation, and education.\nThis comprehensive vision for village development is paramount. Currently, 70% of India's population resides in rural areas, predominantly engaged in an agrarian economy. Despite agriculture and allied sectors employing 51% of the total workforce, their contribution to the country's GDP is a mere 17%. Profound developmental disparities persist between rural and urban sectors, spanning health, education, incomes, basic amenities, and employment opportunities, precipitating widespread discontent and substantial migration to urban centers. The imperative of sustainable development, increasingly acknowledged on a global scale, necessitates eco-friendly rural development and the creation of local employment opportunities. The escalating trend of urbanization is neither sustainable nor desirable. Historically, professional higher education institutions have predominantly catered to the mainstream industrial sector, offering limited direct contributions to rural development. The Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA) emerges as a vital and challenging initiative in steering towards comprehensive rural development.\n[×](javascript:void\\(0\\))\n[__Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bharaticollegeDU/) [__Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bharati_college/) [__ Twitter](https://twitter.com/bharati_college) [__Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@SocialMedia-bt8vr/featured) [__Media Coverage](https://www.bharaticollege.du.ac.in/media-coverage) [__Search](javascript:void\\(0\\);)",
